# Task 4: Object-Oriented Programming Enhancements

## Overview

Task 4 involved significant enhancements to the data pipeline through the implementation of advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns. The goal was to create a highly modular, extensible, and maintainable architecture for data processing tasks, enabling flexible configuration and reuse of processing components.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Abstract Base Class and Inheritance Hierarchy

- Created an abstract base class `DataProcessor` that defines the common interface for all data processors
- Implemented concrete processor classes that inherit from the base class:
  - `DataLoader`: Loads data from various sources
  - `DataCleaner`: Handles missing values, duplicates, and data type issues
  - `TextPreprocessor`: Performs text tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
  - `FeatureTransformer`: Transforms categorical features and creates derived features

### 2. Design Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern**: Implemented `ProcessorDecorator`, `TimingDecorator`, and `LoggingDecorator` to add cross-cutting concerns like timing and logging to processors without modifying their code
- **Composite Pattern**: Created `CompositeProcessor` to treat individual processors and compositions uniformly, allowing nested processing pipelines
- **Factory Pattern**: Implemented `ProcessorFactory` to create and configure processors from type and configuration information
- **Template Method Pattern**: The base `DataProcessor` defines the skeleton of the processing algorithm, with specific steps implemented by subclasses

### 3. Configuration-Driven Architecture

- Developed a JSON-based configuration system that allows pipeline construction without code changes
- The configuration specifies:
  - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
  - Input and output file paths
  - Logging configuration
  - Processor chain with processor-specific configurations
  - Caching and parallelism options

### 4. Metadata and Observability

- Added comprehensive metadata tracking throughout the pipeline
- Implemented timing and logging decorators that capture performance metrics and execution details
- Created a structured logging system for debugging and monitoring

### 5. Testing and Documentation

- Developed unit tests for the new OOP architecture (`test_oop_pipeline.py`)
- Created a detailed class diagram showing relationships between components
- Documented design patterns and architectural decisions

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each processor focuses on a specific aspect of data processing
2. **Extensibility**: New processors can be easily added by subclassing `DataProcessor`
3. **Configurability**: Pipeline behavior can be modified through configuration without code changes
4. **Observability**: Timing and logging decorators provide insights into processing performance
5. **Reusability**: Processors can be reused in different pipelines and configurations
6. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock data

## Files and Components

1. **Core OOP Framework**:
   - `data_processor.py`: Contains the abstract base class, decorators, composite processor, and factory

2. **Pipeline Implementation**:
   - `data_pipeline.py`: Contains concrete processor implementations (refactored to use the OOP framework)
   - `pipeline_config.json`: Configuration file for the data pipeline
   - `run_pipeline.py`: Script to run the pipeline from configuration

3. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - `class_diagram.md`: Visualization of the class hierarchy and relationships
   - `test_oop_pipeline.py`: Unit tests for the OOP architecture
   - `TASK4_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of the OOP enhancements (this file)

## Example Usage

The refactored pipeline can be run using a simple command:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --config pipeline_config.json
```

Different processing configurations can be achieved by modifying the configuration file without changing code. For example, processors can be enabled/disabled, decorators can be applied selectively, and processor-specific parameters can be adjusted.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallelism**: Implement parallel processing of data chunks for better performance
2. **Caching**: Add caching of intermediate results to avoid redundant processing
3. **Visualization**: Create a visualization tool for the pipeline execution and metrics
4. **Pipeline Versioning**: Add versioning and change tracking for pipeline configurations
